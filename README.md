# Hello-World

I am new in the professional IT environment. Attending an IT technical school for network systems and security administration - but I need more hands on experience with coding. Working as a freelance tech for the last two years hasn't been enough of a drive for me to expand my career and interests, so I'm finally getting on GitHub like I've wanted to for years.
